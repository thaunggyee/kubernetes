# Kubernetes Cluster Backup and Restore with Minio 

* In this lab, I will use 4 nodes, one worker,master and three worker nodes. Actually, we should have 5 node, one master and 4 workers. Due to VM limits in my laptop, I will use master node as worker node. And every node has at least 2 additional attached disks for openebs cstor storage. They shouldn't be formatted.
Every node should has at least 2CPU and 4GB RAM to deploy Minio Storage on them.
